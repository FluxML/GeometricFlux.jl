    FeaturedGraph(graph, node_feature, edge_feature, global_feature)

A feature-equipped graph structure for passing graph to layer in order to provide graph dynamically.
References to graph or features are hold in this type.

# Arguments
- `graph`: should be a adjacency matrix, `SimpleGraph`, `SimpleDiGraph` (from LightGraphs) or `SimpleWeightedGraph`, `SimpleWeightedDiGraph` (from SimpleWeightedGraphs).
- `node_feature`: node features attached to graph.
- `edge_feature`: edge features attached to graph.
- `gloabl_feature`: gloabl graph features attached to graph.
